# Gamify
Inspired by the massively successful Quizlet, Gamify includes a wider variation of games to help students study efficiently and productively while having a substantial amount of fun!

### Structure
The program starts with a dashboard in which the user may:
 - import an existing text file with terms and definitions from File Explorer.
 - begin a new study set by adding terms and their corresponding definitions using purely UI.
 - launch one of a wide selection of games using the selected study set.
 ### Games
 #### Match
 A simple drag-and-drop game in which the player drags a term/definition onto its corresponding definition/term in the study set.
 #### Snake
 A take on the classic video game that prompts the player to enter a term's definition when the snake collects food.
 #### Tetris
 A version of Tetris that prompts the player to enter a term's definition in order to clear a line.

# Try it out!
## Unzip the contents of the dist folder to get the Runnable
This will include the necessary jar files along with some study sets to get you started. Only run dashboard.jar, it will run the others by itself when necessary.
## Create your own game!
Gamify is completely open-source, so you are more than welcome to simply drag-and-drop your original games into the program and study the way that fits you best.
